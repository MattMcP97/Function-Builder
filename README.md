# Function-Builder
Console app that allows the user to enter, save, and reuse a math function

The function is saved as a structure of two arrays.
A character array saves the operations, and a float array saves the operands.
Operations are carried out in the order in which they were saved.

Example:
char array: {a, c}
float array: {2, 4}
function: (x + 2) * 4 = y
